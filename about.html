		<p class="hasan">I know you read the description.
And you expect for me to fall in love with you.
That, or you already read this story and you just want to see me suffer again.
It’s hard to see through the screen… I can’t tell one reader from another, boy or girl. Not that it would matter…
(Blushes deeply) Anyway, that’s not the point.
You should leave.
Why are you going to the next slide?
Stop doing that.
Are you always this stubborn?
I said st-
Don’t interrupt me.

		<p class="raj">My mother said that out of all five of her children
I was the easiest baby
I think what she meant was that I hardly cried,
Rarely fussed
And was generally asleep
Which I guess was a good thing, for her
As the fourth of five she had a lot to deal with before she could get to me
So I made it easier for her
I kept doing it as I grew up
If one of my siblings dropped their ice cream,
I’d give them mine so they’d stop making a scene
When someone had to sit in a middle seat
You can bet that’s where my car seat would be strapped
In fifth grade, when Clara Gomez stole my cookie from my lunch box
I just shrugged, and ate my carrot sticks
My nickname was “montañita”, little mountain
Because I was never moved, never bothered, always calm
In seventh grade, I broke my leg
But I didn’t tell anyone for three days
I just gritted my teeth and hopped along
Until my father found me crying on the bathroom floor
He took me to the hospital, and bought me a cast we couldn’t afford
And when the kids at school called me a cripple
Well, you can guess what I did
In high school, my little sister Sofia was getting picked on by some boys
I pretended I didn’t see it happen
But that night, I switched out her too-small uniform skirt for mine
She stopped getting teased,
And I wore pants for the rest of the year
When my college Algebra professor lost my test and made me retake it, I just nodded and did it
When I got catcalled walking across campus,
I just looked down at the ground
And you
The first day you came up to me and offered to buy me coffee
I was sure you were making fun of me too
So I stayed quiet
Eventually, you flashed me that blinding smile and told me, “Guess I’ll take that as a yes, then.”
I think I said about three words to you that first day
But I gave you my number
And answered when you called
</p>
		<p class="aryan">Butter
Sugar
Flour
A pinch of cinnamon
“It looks delicious baby”
I turned around to see my husband behind me
“What are you making today?”
I smiled and pointed to the recipe on the counter
“Cinnamon bread? You spoil me”
I smiled again, and he placed a kiss on my bare shoulder
“How much longer do you have on these?”
I glanced at the clock, doing the math in my head
I held up 10 fingers
“Alright, I suppose I can wait”
I cocked my head at him, raising an eyebrow
“No, no, I’ll wait till you’re done. Finish your bread.”
I shook my head at him fondly, pouring the batter into the tin
“Hey”
I looked back at him
“You’re pretty”
I rolled my eyes, sprinkling the crumb topping over the batter
As soon as I placed the tin in the oven, I felt his arms wrapping around me
